This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to set up a React app from a GitHub repository on your local machine.

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 10 or higher)
Git
## Step 1: Clone the repository
Clone the repository containing your React app to your local machine using the following command:

### git clone <repository-url>

## Step 2: Install dependencies

To install the dependencies for your React app, navigate to the directory containing the app and run the following command:

### npm install

This will install all the packages listed in the package.json file.

## Step 3: Start the app
